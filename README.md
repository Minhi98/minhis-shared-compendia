### Proficiency without Level

Changes and adjustments are based off of my [PwL Adjustments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gjBxrdQMJUpBZesnUYN9WI0pE_FLay4pGyPJGcNz7uY/edit?usp=sharing) sheet. Compendiums have been put in to provide support for common things, such as treat wounds. As of writing, certain macros (e.g. "Generate Check Prompt") cannot be edited because they make calls to the system's internal API. 

The inbuilt variant rule simply subtracts the level from level-based DCs. In the compendiums are reference macros for Simple, Level-Based and Spell Rank DCs that can be used for quick reference while Generate Check Prompt is open.
