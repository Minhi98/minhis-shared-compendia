# Minhi's Shared Compendia

This foundry module contains implementations of my homebrew rules or 3PP modules which lack foundry support.

Manifest: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Minhi98/minhis-shared-compendia/main/module.json`

## Supported Content

Systems and Misc.
- My Camping Rules with support for [Kingmaker Tools' Camping Sheet](https://github.com/BernhardPosselt/pf2e-kingmaker-tools)
- Proficiency without Level

Ancestries & Heritages
- (Poppet Heritage) Plain Porcelain Doll

Archetypes
- Class Paragon

3PP
- Home-Base Handbook (+ additional room modules, personal errata)
- Dreamer Class by Raven Haunts (until an official module is available)
- Harvest Creature activity for Heroic Crafting (to handle monster parts gathering)

And various personal utilities such as common sheets with tokens set up, generic whiteboard scenes and playlists for my own convenience.

### Proficiency without Level

Changes and adjustments are based off of my [PwL Adjustments](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gjBxrdQMJUpBZesnUYN9WI0pE_FLay4pGyPJGcNz7uY/edit?usp=sharing) sheet. Compendiums have been put in to provide support for common things, such as treat wounds. As of writing, certain macros (e.g. "Generate Check Prompt") cannot be edited because they make calls to the system's internal API. 

The inbuilt variant rule simply subtracts the level from level-based DCs. In the compendiums are reference macros for Simple, Level-Based and Spell Rank DCs that can be used for quick reference while Generate Check Prompt is open.
